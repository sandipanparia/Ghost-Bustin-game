For this weeks `CodePenChallenge` I've created a pure CSS game. A "whack-a-mole" type game where you bust ghosts by tapping them 💪

It leverages checkbox tricks and the use of `counter-increment` to keep score.

It also leverages `CSS variables` to assign scores to ghosts along with their speed and delay.

Finally, it's wrapped in a form so we can reset everything with a `type='reset'` at the end 👍

Best viewed in Full Screen mode.

Enjoy! 🕹
